[Tracy](http://tracy.nette.org) - PHP debugger
==============================================


Library Tracy is a useful everyday helper PHP programmer. It will help you

- quickly detect and correct errors
- log errors
- as listing variables
- and measure the time


PHP is a language for chopping hardly stripped errors as perfect as it gives developers a great deal of flexibility.
That is a valuable debugging tool Tracy\Debugger. Among the diagnostic tools for PHP is the ultimate.
If you are now experiencing Tracy first time, believe me, your life starts to divide Tracy the one before and the one with her.
Welcome to the good part!

The best way to install Tracy is to download latest package from http://tracy.nette.org or using Composer:

		php composer.phar require tracy/tracy

Tracy easily activate, simply enter the code, preferably immediately after the reading framework, add:

```php
use Tracy\Debugger;

Debugger::enable();
```

The first thing you notice on the site is Debugger Bar.


Debugger Bar
------------

Debugger Bar is a floating panel that is displayed in the lower right corner of the page. We can move the mouse, and after reloading the page will remember its position.

Do Debugger Bar can add other useful panels. A number of them can be found in http://addons.nette.org.


Visualization of errors and exceptions
--------------------------

Surely you know how PHP reports errors: in the source code of the page will output something like this:

```pre
<b>Parse error</b>:  syntax error, unexpected T_STRING in <b>DashboardPresenter.php</b> on line <b>8</b>
```

or uncaught exception:

```pre
<b>Fatal error</b>:  Uncaught exception 'MemberAccessException' with message 'Call to undefined method Nette\Http\User::isLogedIn().' in D:\Web\Nette.web\libs\Nette\ObjectMixin.php:69
Stack trace:
#0 D:\Web\Nette.web\libs\Nette\Object.php(80): ObjectMixin::call(Object(User), 'isLogedIn', Array)
#1 [internal function]: Object-&gt;__call('isLogedIn', Array)
#2 D:\Web\cd-collection\app\presenters\DashboardPresenter.php(12): User-&gt;isLogedIn()
#3 D:\Web\Nette.web\libs\Nette\Application\Presenter.php(154): DashboardPresenter-&gt;startup()
#4 D:\Web\Nette.web\libs\Nette\Application\Application.php(148): Presenter-&gt;run(Object(PresenterRequest))
#5 D:\Web\cd-collection\app\bootstrap.php(54): Application-&gt;run()
#6 D:\Web\cd-collection\index.php(13): require('D:\Web\cd-colle...')
#7 {main}
  thrown in <b>D:\Web\Nette.web\libs\Nette\ObjectMixin.php</b> on line <b>69</b>
```

In this extract is not very easy to navigate. If we switch Tracy, error or exception is displayed completely in a different form:


[![Uncaught exception in design Tracy](http://files.nette.org/2910/debugger1.png)](http://examples.nette.org/ndebug/nette-exception.html)


Error message literally screams, we see part of the source code with the highlighted line where the error occurred, information Call to undefined method Nette\Http\User::isLogedIn() clearly explains your error is. The entire site is also live, we can click through to more detail. Try it.

And you know what? In this way, capture and display a fatal error. Without the need to install any extension.


[![Uncaught exception in design Tracy](http://files.nette.org/2910/debugger2.png)](http://examples.nette.org/ndebug/nette-error.html)

Errors as a typo in a variable name or an attempt to open a nonexistent file, generate reports of level E_NOTICE or E_WARNING. These can be in graphics page makes it easy to overlook even be visible at all (except by looking at the page code).

```php
Debugger::$strictMode = TRUE;
```


To detect typos even when assigned to an object variable, we inherit his class from Nette\Object.


We can also change the depth of nesting by `Debugger::$maxDepth` and length label displayed by `Debugger::$maxLen`. Lower values Tracy naturally accelerates.

```php
Debugger::$maxDepth = 2; // default: 3
Debugger::$maxLen = 50; // default: 150
```


Production mode and error logging
-------------------------------

As you can see, is quite eloquent Tracy, which can be appreciated in the development environment, while on the production server it would cause disaster ready. There is no debugging information list can not. Tracy therefore has autodetection environment and where to run stark example of a server error instead of showing zaloguje a visitor sees only user-comprehensible message:

![Tracy](http://files.nette.org/2910/debugger3.png)

Output mode suppresses all debugging information that we send out via `Debugger::dump()` or `Debugger::fireLog()`, and of course all the error messages generated by PHP. So if you have forgotten the code `Debugger::dump($obj)`, do not have to worry about on a production server does not list anything.

The mode switching is used the first parameter of `Debugger::enable()`, where you can specify either a constant `Debugger::PRODUCTION` or `Debugger::DEVELOPMENT`.

If it is not specified, the default value of `Debugger::DETECT` in which case the system detects a server by IP address - if available via the public IP address running in production mode, where the local and the developer. In most cases it is not necessary to set the mode to recognize and correctly depending on whether you are launching an application on your local server or in production.

In production mode automatically Tracy all errors and exceptions captured logs to a text log. Unless you specify otherwise, it will be a set of log/error.log . Error while logging is extremely useful. Imagine that all users of your application are actually betatesters who are doing cutting-edge work for free in search of bugs and you do stupid if you threw away their valuable reports unnoticed to the recycle bin.

If you need a log in your own message or you caught an exception, use the method `log()`:

```php
Debugger::log('Unexpected error'); // text message

try {
	failureOperation();
} catch (Exception $e) {
	Debugger::log($e); // log exception
	// or Debugger::log($e, Debugger::ERROR) // sends also an email notification
}
```

Different directory for logging errors can be set by the second parameter methods enable():

```php
Debugger::enable(Debugger::DETECT, __DIR__ . '/mylog');
```

Ringer for the real error log is a key source of information and wants to be informed immediately of any new error. Tracy him in that caters to, is capable of a new record in the log inform you by e-mail. Where do you send the e-mails we identify the variable $email:

```php
Debugger::$email = 'admin@example.com';
```


However, in order to overwhelm you e-mail box, sends **only one message** and creates a file `email-sent`. Developer when you receive e-mail notifications check the log, correct application and monitoring deletes a file, which in turn activates the sending of e-mails.


Dump variables
---------------

Each tuner is a good friend with the function `var_dump` in detail, lists the contents of the variable. Unfortunately, the environment loses HTML formatting and extract decanted into a single line of HTML code sanitizaci not to mention. In practice, it is necessary `var_dump` replace handier functions. That is just `Debugger::dump()`.

```php
$arr = array(10, 20.2, TRUE, NULL, 'hello');

Debugger::dump($arr);
// including namespace Tracy\Debugger::dump($arr);
```

generates the output:

```pre
<pre><span style="color:gray">array</span>(5) {
  [0] => <span style="color:gray">int</span>(10)
  [1] => <span style="color:gray">float</span>(20.2)
  [2] => <span style="color:gray">bool</span>(true)
  [3] => <span style="color:gray">NULL</span>
  [4] => <span style="color:gray">string</span>(5) "hello"
}
</pre>
```


Timing
-----------

Another useful tool is the debugger stopwatch accurate to microseconds:

```php
Debugger::timer();

// sweet dreams ma cherrie
sleep(2);

$elapsed = Debugger::timer();
// $elapsed ? 2
```

An optional parameter can be achieved by multiple measurements.

```php
Debugger::timer('page-generating');
// some conde
Debugger::timer('rss-generating');

// some code
$rssElapsed = Debugger::timer('rss-generating');
$pageElapsed = Debugger::timer('page-generating');
```



```php
Debugger::timer(); // runs timer

... // some difficult operation

echo Debugger::timer(); // elapsed time in seconds
```





Firebug and FireLogger
--------------------

We can not always send debugging information to the browser window. This applies to Ajax requests, or generate XML output files. In such a case, we can send messages to a separate channel in Firebug. Errors Notice and Warning levels are to Firebug window even sent automatically. It is also possible to log exceptions caught while an application, but it is worth it to draw attention to them.

How to do it?

1) download and run Firefox browser
2) download extension [Firebug](http://www.getfirebug.com)
3) download extension  [FireLogger](http://firelogger.binaryage.com)
4) restart browser, turn on Firebug (klávesou F12) and enable network (Net) and Logger


... Open our utility panel and click on the Console. Ha! I moved error message.


Because Tracy\Debugger communicates with Firebug via HTTP headers, you must call the logging function even before the PHP script sends anything to the output. It is also possible to enable output buffering and the output delay.

```php
use Tracy\Debugger;

Debugger::fireLog('Hello World'); // render string into Firebug console

Debugger::fireLog($_SERVER); // or even arrays and objects

Debugger::fireLog(new Exception('Test Exception')); // or exceptions
```

The result looks like this:
